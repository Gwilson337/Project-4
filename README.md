# Project-4
## NFL Fantasy Football Stats
## Overview
For this project we researched NFL fantasy football data provided by Fantasy Pros. We looked at the years 2019-2023. The records included team, player rank, position, points accumulated for each of the 18 weeks, the average amount of points, and the total amount of points for each season. We aimed to build a model that could predict the total amount of points each player would score for the upcoming season, which could then be used to predict the player's rank.
